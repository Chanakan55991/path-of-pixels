\h{The start for a startup}
\l{I} just finished my first prototype of a startup today. It's called MorMap, and it is surreal to me that what is used to be just a thought, a thought where we can simply find the clinic close to us, see the clinic status in real time, while also knowing all the information related to that clinic in so much details. Something even Google Maps can't provide. It is definitely something that will change a lot of people. Since rather than having to wait 4-5 hours, more or less, for the doctor, or get stuck in a traffic. We can simply either reserve the spot beforehand, or ask as when the doctor will arrive/is free, so on and so forth.

My team approved the features as of now, the design will definitely need to be change later, as it is still in a very early stage and we don't have a proper graphic designer yet. It it also very tiring to do a bunch of stuff solo, as currently we don't have anyone else to help with the software side of things just yet. So it is just me doing both frontend and backend part. So I figured I might also do something else as a side hustle. Like writing journals, and making a website to put them online. That feels pretty interesting and fun, this is what the journal website looks like:

\h{A reader who writes}
\l{B}ought a new book today! As an avid reader, I bought a bunch of books, and I love reading them. Something about reading a books, or just readings in general, is pretty relaxing and fun to me. Reading what the others have wrote for a specific things, like their life, their experiences, etc. One of my favorite books is The Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carroll. It explains the method he used to jot down things to do, remember tasks, events, or simply take notes in general, in the form of bullet points, which he called it,  Bullet Journal, or BUJO, for short. I would say, the method definitely got me interested in writings, and also stationary, which is one of the reason I got a fountain pen!

The method also somehow made me feels more confident to write something out, that led me to start my own blog at https://blog.chanakancloud.net. I also love to summarize a book into a simple single or multiple pages summary lately. It just feels fun to write something out. This journal is definitely one of the way I can write my thought out as it flow.

Eventually I might just start writing a book, Who knows! I have familiarized myself with \LaTeX (The very typesetting system I am using to write this journal), so writing books would not be hard.

I will start reading the book I just bought, And I might as well start summarizing them on my website. This is the book:

\h{Music: The Healing Melodies}
\l{H}ave you ever listened to a piece of music that perfectly captures the emotions you're experiencing at the moment? I for sure did. And it feels amazing somehow, to listen to a music whose meaning hit so close to home. One of my favorite songs is Childhood Paradise by Plastic Plastic. The song is about a person reminiscing about their past childhood life, the time where everything is much simpler, you had so much fun. Now it might not exactly been like before, but you would love to keep those memories alive for as long as it is possible. There's some part of that song that is hitting me hard. Since life can take quite the turn when you go from a kid to a teenager, and a teenager, to an adult. It kinda makes me feels sad and happy at the same times, sad that those times might not happen as much as before, happy that it had happened, and would be kept in my memories for as long as it is.

Music can be touching in so many ways, Like the song "Portrait of a Blank Slate" by Lovejoy. While the lyrics does not necessary captures my emotions at the time I'm listening. What I love about it is the music video, which used a bunch of public domain stock footage, which looks kinda fun and interesting.

I've seen someone that feels sad due to a specific reason I would not say here. And the only thing that would make them feels better is by listening to music. I feels like, most of the times, music is the healing melodies of its own. It just seems to have the power of healing people. It can be understanding, and calming to some.

This is also the reason I love listening to music, lots of them. Basically when I am doing absolutely anything, I would listen to certain type of music, based on what I am doing at the moment. Namely, I would listen to Jazz or Lo-Fi when I'm doing works, and I would listen to Pop or Indie when I'm just chilling, but those can change depends on my mood really :D

The music I'm currently listening is "Old With You" by grentperez. Which is the song about living a life that retains its youthful days even after the test of time. “If I ever grow old” is a funny line to me. Growing up is pretty much inevitable, but it conveys the message of always having that youthful mentality. And even if you were to grow older, you will always have someone by your side.

\h{Sherbet Sky}
\l{T}oday might as well be one of the best day out there, it is raining slightly, and some part of the sky had already started to open up, and I can see the sky glowing in orange and blue, it looks pretty amazing and calming. I love to call these types of sky "Sherbet Sky" since it pretty much looks like some kind of sherbet (the dessert). It looks sweet and soft. Don't you just want to eat the cloud sometimes? Well I guess maybe not everyone! Days like this just keeps bringing me back memories from when I was younger. Something about the sky just makes me reminisce my past, not sure actually which memories, it came by for a very brief moment, then it's gone again. It's a chill morning with slight wind. Really gotta appreciate it while it last. Just like being with people, or a places. You'd never know you will miss them until they are gone.

Might as well be talking too much about the sky here. But anyways, you really just need to enjoy what you have while it last, don't you?

\h{Be Positive; Shoot Negative}
\l{I} know we all have heard about film photography. But does anyone ever knows them for real, the one that's not a mobile app or filter version. Do they ever know different types of film, from different brand, and different ASA\footnote{Also known as ISO} for each of them, I don't know about anyone else, but I love shooting actual film. The sound of a shutter opening up the window to let the light shine into the actual film itself, and the fact that you let the real life light beamed onto the film directly, kinda makes the images that got scanned out off of it feels more lively than ever. With good lens and decent film, you can go a long way with it. I actually love medium format film more than 35mm, more specifically, I like the camera named "Mamiya 7". I've got to tried them once when I was slightly younger, and I am amazed by how everything works. And so it have been on my mind ever since.

Film photography will always surprise me in anyway possible, from waiting for the result from the lab, to each of the film that made up special looking images, like the Kodak Aerochrome, which will display any infrared light reflected into the film as red, which looks totally amazing.

\newpage

One of my favorite film stock is, well, Aerochrome, and also Fuji Pro 400h. I liked the Aerochrome for the reason it display infrared in such wonderful ways, and I liked Fuji Pro 400h for the slightly muted result it gives, which is what I love coming out off of a film.

I hope more people will realize that shooting actual film is actually interesting and fun even in the ages where everything is digital. I guess you can't just replace the authentic feeling you might get when shooting film.
